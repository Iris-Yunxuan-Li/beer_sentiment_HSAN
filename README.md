# Beer Review Classification with Hierarchical Self-Attention Networks

This project explores the use of Hierarchical Self-Attention Networks (HSAN) for classifying beer reviews based on their sentiment. The model integrates self-attention mechanisms and convolutional layers to analyze and predict the sentiment of reviews, classifying them into positive or negative categories.

The project includes a Jupyter notebook that covers data preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation. The notebook leverages pre-trained word embeddings and a hierarchical approach to capture the complex relationships within text data.

## Features
 - Data Loading & Preprocessing: Load and preprocess beer review data, including tokenization and encoding.
 - Hierarchical Self-Attention Model: Definition of a model combining self-attention and convolutional layers for sentiment classification.
 - Training & Evaluation: Training of the model with detailed metrics and evaluation on validation and test sets.
