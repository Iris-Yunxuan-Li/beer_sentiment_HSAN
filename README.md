# Beer Review Sentiment Classification with Hierarchical Self-Attention Networks (HSAN)

## Overview

This project aims to classify beer reviews based on sentiment using a Hierarchical Self-Attention Network (HSAN). The model incorporates pre-trained word embeddings and un-trained embeddings and employs a hierarchical structure to analyze the sentiment at both the review and sentence levels.

## Benchmarking with Convolutional Layer
To evaluate the performance of the HSAN model, a convolutional layer was added as a benchmark. The goal was to compare the results of the HSAN against a convolutional approach.

### Results
Both models performed similarly in sentiment classification, indicating that either could be effective depending on the context. However, the performance might be influenced by the non-optimal configurations used for both models, suggesting that further tuning could yield better results.
